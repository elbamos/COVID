This repo is for some friends and I to experiment with various things based on COVID-19 data.

If you're looking for reliable epidemiological advice, this isn't where you should be looking.

## Status

- The primary data sources are in (Johns Hopkins, county-and-state level from NY Times, the Keysteon Strategy list of interventions,  state level testing data from COVID track, and the NYC DOH).  
- Data sources are polled periodically.  
- I haven't put in any modelling or epidemiology yet
